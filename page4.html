        <h2> How to reskill yourself in today's workforce</h2>
        <img src="z.jpg" width="700" height="400">
        <p>The two positions may seem unrelated at first glance, but the New Jersey Nets wanted someone who could evaluate player stats and past performance to help determine the best combinations of team members to put on the court in various situations. With superior mathematical and analytical skills, the hedge fund analyst fit the bill.

Transferable skills – abilities that can be applied to different work environments – can be among a job seeker's strongest assets. Here's a look at some of the most in-demand transferable skills and how to acquire them.</p>
        <h4>What do employers want?</h4>
        <p>Simply put, "They want skills that can increase or develop business," says David Couper, a career coach and author of "Outsiders on the Inside: How to Create a Winning Career ... Even When You Don't Fit In." "Organizations want anything that will make them more successful and more profitable."

Some commonly sought-after talents include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Communication skills:</b>   "Writing, training/teaching others, speaking and listening are all important because being a good communicator can make a person more successful at his job – whatever that job may be," says Brian Drum, founder and president of Drum Associates, a global executive search firm located in New York City.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Customer service and sales:</b> "Your ability to build lasting and profitable relationships is almost always transferable," Mathison says. "This idea actually can extend to nonprofits and public jobs. Think about donors, voters, constituents, students and even vendors."
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Negotiation skills: </b>"If you can show a track record of saving your employer money by using your good negotiation skills, you become a more desirable employee," Drum states.
            </li>
       
        </ul></p>
        <h4>Developing transferable skills</h4>
        <p>Some transferable skills are acquired through education and experience. For instance, demonstrated computer proficiency in a previous position may give a prospective employer confidence that you can quickly master a new company's specific system.

Likewise, experts suggest reading books geared towards specific objectives, such as becoming a better negotiator.

Couper notes that volunteering or taking on special projects offers the opportunity to work on skills valued in the workplace. For instance, one of his clients was involved with a not-for-profit group and became part of its selection committee responsible for hiring leaders. He later highlighted this experience to an employer to land a job with human resource duties.</p>
        <h4>Presenting transferable skills</h4>
        <p>So is the hedge fund analyst turned basketball advisor a rarity? No – any job seeker who can pinpoint a legitimate match between her skills and an employer's needs has the potential to be hired.

For example, Mathison recalls working with a former Navy SEAL who was having difficulty finding a job. While employers respected his elite training, they "just didn't know what to do with someone who knew how to land on sandy beaches and blow things up." But once he started making the connection for them as to how his background and training were applicable to their goals, employers took notice. He was hired by a high technology global company on the basis of his transferable skill of leading teams to get critical things done anywhere in the world with resourcefulness when unexpected events threatened to derail the project's timeline.</p>
